Hello,do you have free rooms for 6 Mountain bikers in the night from Monday 6 July 2015 to Tuesday July 2015? We were in your Hotel in 2013 and it was wonderful.  We like to have three rooms:- one single room- one double room- one triple room
Can you tell me the price for the rooms including breakfast?
Is it possible to have a garage or a cellar room for our mountainbikes?
Do you have a offer for a meal in the evening?
With kind regards,
